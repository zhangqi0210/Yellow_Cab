## Introduction

This repository houses the Jupyter Notebook and associated resources for a comprehensive case study of the Yellow Cab company. The objective is to employ data analysis techniques and Python programming to derive actionable business insights.

---

## Instructions

The notebook aligns with the sections outlined in the case document. It's highly recommended to consult the case document concurrently while going through the notebook.

---

## Technologies and Tools

- **Python 3.x**: The primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents containing live code.
- **pandas**: A data manipulation library.
- **matplotlib and seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning algorithms.

---

## Installation and Setup

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/zhangqi0210/Yellow_Cab.git my-project
cd my-project
```

---

## Data Sources

The data for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data).

---

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of null values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that better represent the problem space.
- **Data Transformation**: Scaling and normalization.

```
python
# Example code snippet for data cleaning
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed using various statistical graphics, plots, and information tables. Key techniques include:

- **Distribution Analysis**
- **Correlation Analysis**
- **Time Series Analysis**

```
python
# Example code snippet for EDA
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)
```

---

## Modeling and Algorithms

We employ machine learning algorithms to understand patterns and make predictions. Algorithms used include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Clustering Algorithms**

---

## Results and Findings

The results are presented in a digestible format supported by:

- **Charts and Graphs**: For visual representation of data.
- **Tables**: For statistical analysis.
- **Code Snippets**: To underline the technical competency.

---

## Code Snippets

Here are some key code snippets that showcase the complexity and capabilities of the analysis:

```python
# Example of a complex query using pandas
result = df.groupby(['Category'])['Revenue'].sum().reset_index()
```

---

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The project concludes by summarizing the key findings and proposing data-driven recommendations for Yellow Cab. The methods and analyses conducted showcase a strong competency in data analysis and Python programming.
